        <Lyrics>Hello?<br/>Is there anybody in there?<br/>Just nod if you can hear me.<br/>Is there anyone at home?<br/>Come on, now,<br/>I hear you're feeling down.<br/>Well I can ease your pain<br/>Get you on your feet again.<br/>Relax.<br/>I'll need some information first.<br/>Just the basic facts.<br/>Can you show me where it hurts?<br/><br/>There is no pain you are receding<br/>A distant ship, smoke on the horizon.<br/>You are only coming through in waves.<br/>Your lips move but I can't hear what you're saying.<br/>When I was a child I had a fever<br/>My hands felt just like two balloons.<br/>Now I've got that feeling once again<br/>I can't explain you would not understand<br/>This is not how I am.<br/>I have become comfortably numb.<br/><br/>O.K.<br/>Just a little pinprick.<br/>There'll be no more aaaaaaaaah!<br/>But you may feel a little sick.<br/>Can you stand up?<br/>I do believe it's working, good.<br/>That'll keep you going through the show<br/>Come on it's time to go.<br/><br/>There is no pain you are receding<br/>A distant ship, smoke on the horizon.<br/>You are only coming through in waves.<br/>Your lips move but I can't hear what you're saying.<br/>When I was a child <br/>I caught a fleeting glimpse<br/>Out of the corner of my eye.<br/>I turned to look but it was gone<br/>I cannot put my finger on it now<br/>The child is grown, <br/>The dream is gone.<br/>I have become comfortably numb.</Lyrics>
